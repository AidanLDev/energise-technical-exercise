# Developer Technical Exercise

The purpose of this exercise is to assess candidates on equal parts data handling, visualisation, knowledge of appropriate tooling.

## Brief
Our client, "Logo Text Here" has supplied cumulative carbon emissions data in csv format (anon_carbon_data.csv). We want to display the weekly emissions back to them in a clear way.

### Steps
1. Transform the data so that it is weekly, not cumulative.
1. Display the data on a graph with the x axis being weeks and the y axis being carbon emitted that week in tCO2e (a standard unit)

### Considerations
- Data transformation should be done programmatically, therefore no excel or similar tools are to be used.
- Any reasonable programming language may be used. Use something comfortable, but capable.
- Once the program has run, the csv file should remain unchanged, and no new csv file created.
- The quality of the visualisation should be such that you would feel comfortable presenting it to a paid client.
- The type and style of the graph should be such that it conveys meaning to the client (no pie charts!!)
- It is desired that the client eventually access the data through the web, meaning that it must be displayed in the browser.
- The client would like their logo displayed in the top right corner, with appropriate padding.
- While the browser aspect is important, please do not create a full user experience, with authentications etc. Just a graph and logo on a page is sufficient.
- The client will be viewing on a desktop. No need to make it responsive.
- Please prepare a short walkthrough of your code, demonstrating your thought process, tools used, any challenges, and any other relevant information. This should be no more than 5 minutes.
- An hour, maybe two, is a reasonable amount of time to spend on this. It is not our intention that candidates lose valuable free time completing this exercise. If in doubt, call a halt to the work and present what you have.

## Best of luck!
